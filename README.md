# Personal Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal developer portfolio.  
The site is intended to showcase my projects, technical skills, and experience as a Computer Science student.

Over time, this portfolio will evolve into a self-updating site that integrates with GitHub to automatically reflect new projects and activity.

---

## 🚀 Goals
- Create a clean, professional portfolio for recruiters and internship applications
- Showcase real projects with clear descriptions and code
- Integrate GitHub data (commits, repositories, activity)
- Automate updates and deployments using CI/CD

---

## 🛠️ Planned Tech Stack
*(Subject to iteration as the project evolves)*

- Frontend: TBD (React / Next.js / Astro)
- Styling: CSS / Tailwind CSS
- Deployment: GitHub Pages or cloud hosting
- Automation: GitHub Actions
- APIs: GitHub REST API
