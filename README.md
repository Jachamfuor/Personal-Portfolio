# Personal Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal developer portfolio.   
The site is intended to showcase my projects, technical skills, and experience as a Computer Science student.  

Over time, this portfolio will evolve into a **self-updating site** that integrates with GitHub to automatically reflect new projects and activity.

---

## 🚀 Goals
- Create a clean, professional portfolio for recruiters and internship applications
- Showcase real projects with clear descriptions and code
- Publish technical blog posts using a content-as-code workflow
- Integrate GitHub data (commits, repositories, activity)
- Automate updates and deployments using CI/CD

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*(Iterative as the project evolves)*

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React) + TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Content:** MDX (Markdown + JSX)
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## 🔄 Planned Features
- MDX-powered blog for technical writing and project breakdowns
- Automated GitHub activity tracking (commits, repositories)
- Self-updating homepage sections driven by generated data
