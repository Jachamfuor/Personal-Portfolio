summary: "My goal is to build a recruiter-first portfolio that updates itself using GitHub automation."
---

## The goal
I wanted a portfolio that stays current without me constantly editing it.  

## What I’m building
- Next.js + TypeScript site
- MDX blog
- GitHub activity automation (coming next)  

## Why it matters
This project mirrors real SWE workflows: APIs, CI/CD, and maintainable content.
